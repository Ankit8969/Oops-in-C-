Object Oriented Programming Concept;

# What is Oops ?
The fullForm of Oops is Object Oriented Programming System
as the name suggest Object in Programming.By using Object Oriented Programming
we are using the real world entities like Inheritance , Encapsulation , Polymorphism, Abstraction in Programming.
This is called Object Oriented Programming System.

# Characterstic of Oops

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism

# Class

Class is a user defined data types. In class we can define data member and member function together.
and we are not able to use the data member or member function dirrectly for using this first we have to 
create the instance of class which is called Object.
Note: When we create the class It does't take any memory util we can't create any instance of that class(i.e OBject)


# Encapsulation

In Object Oriented Programming , Encapsulation is the binding the data member and the member function together this is 
known as Encapsulation.

#Abstraction

Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the un-necessary data.

Important concept in Abstraction is Access Modifier

It plays a very important role in data hiding
. Public
. Private
. Protected

# Public variable or function we can easily accessed from the outside of the class
# Private and Protected we can't access it from the outside of the class
# IN case of Protected we can access the protected data by using inheritance.


# Inheritance
Using the Data member or member function of other class.this property is called as Inheritance.
Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”


# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a feature of OOPs that allows the object to behave differently in different conditions
