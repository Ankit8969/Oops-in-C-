OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)
Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

Cpp Oops concept 1

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Object
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

Polymorphism
When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
